                        Git is a version control system; you can think of it as a series of snapshots (commits) of your code base.
                        With the creation of each snapshot you build out a whole application, seeing the growth of a full app. During this time
                        you can make branches to experiment and come back to a previous snapshots you took or merge those experiments into your app.
                    </p>

                    <p>GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration.
                            It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere using those code snapshots
                            that you took during development.

                        snapshot giving us a new snapshot of our

                        where we can place all of our current code. This is where the outside
                    world can see our code base.

                    all of our repositories. Other developers might look at our existing projects to see hoe we approached problems,
                    pull down our code and add new features or even update our code base with features
                    they wanted to add.
